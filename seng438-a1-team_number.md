# Introduction

**An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab**

In preparation for this lab, our initial perception of exploratory testing aligned closely with the principles of black box testing. In both methodologies, the tester engages with the system without prior knowledge of its internal code workings. However, delving into this assignment provided us with a more nuanced understanding. We recognized that the key distinction lies in the dynamic nature of exploratory testing, wherein the tester actively explores the software and spontaneously generates test cases. On the contrary, black box testing focuses primarily on the system's functionality.

Our group adopted a holistic approach, viewing both exploratory and black box testing as a combined effort. In our testing endeavors, we sought not only to identify defects, as expected in exploratory methods but also to ensure the accurate functionality of the system, including precise mathematical and practical behavior of the ATM.

Upon encountering the term "manual functional testing," our initial assumption was rooted in the idea of developing test code similar to our approach in unit testing. However, we swiftly grasped that code would not be provided. Manual functional testing, akin to exploratory testing, involves testing the system without access to internal code details. The crucial distinction lies in the source of the test cases. In exploratory testing, tests are improvised during the execution, while in manual testing, test cases are pre-created, necessitating a comparison between expected and actual outputs.

Both exploratory and manual functional testing were novel to our group, accustomed as we were to testing code we developed, giving us insight into the system's internal workings. The exposure to testing without interacting with the code introduced us to a new dimension of creativity. This approach, where the tester remains unaware of the code intricacies and empathizes directly with the user experience, offers a practical means of optimizing software products.


# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

To initiate the testing phase effectively, a tester engages in exploratory testing, an approach devoid of predefined structures. This method encourages testers to delve into the intricacies of the program, uncovering its strengths and weaknesses through a more individual-guided exploration. The resulting test cases can be unconventional and go beyond detection in systematic testing approaches.

To maintain clarity and agility, the tester breaks down the application by function, establishing an adaptable workflow and gaining a directional understanding for exploration. Identifying where to focus testing is as crucial as the test cases themselves. This encourages testers to transcend formal test boundaries, envisioning the application as a sequence of events or a narrative. The ATM simulation is categorized based on functionality, encompassing various services and customer options:


- System startup/shutdown
- Card validation and PIN entry
- Withdrawal
- Deposit
- Transfer
- Balance inquiry
- Transaction abort
- Bank communication
- Transaction failure
- Receipt generation
- Operator function
- Timeout
- Log


This structured breakdown serves as a foundational framework for exploration. Group members individually explore each function, discovering both fundamental and unique test cases. This method establishes predefined criteria for defect reporting and facilitates peer review, ensuring a standardized evaluation across the team. It supports collaborative exploration while prompting the discovery of both common and exceptional paths, aligning with the purpose of exploratory testing.

The testing approach for each function is context-dependent, considering real-world factors and the criticality of the application. Critical security functions like card validation and PIN entry demand extensive testing to solidify their robustness in real-world scenarios. Functions such as withdrawal, deposit, and transfer require a blend of extensive and common scenario testing due to their frequent usage (resulting in common troubleshoot scenarios) and the need for secure transactions. Operator functions, on the other hand, warrant moderate testing, as their basic purpose tends to avoid unique edge cases. Each function of the system undergoes a separate consideration to determine the appropriateness of extensive testing, providing a level of control to the exploratory testing process.

Upon completion of individual explorations, test cases are collated and compared to ensure comprehensive coverage and address any potential gaps. This collaborative approach not only promotes a unified evaluation but also enriches the testing process with diverse perspectives and insights from each team member to capture edge cases.


# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

**Exploratory Testing for the ATM System:**

Benefits:
- Flexibility and Adaptability: Well-suited for exploring complex scenarios and functionalities of the ATM system.
- Finding Unspecified Defects: Effective in discovering defects and scenarios not explicitly covered in predefined test cases.

Tradeoffs:
- Limited Documentation: Lack of formal test cases may result in challenges in tracking and replicating tests.
- Varied Coverage: Depending on the tester's intuition, coverage may vary, potentially missing critical paths.

Effectiveness:
- Quick Identification of Defects: Identifying unexpected issues as testers continue to explore, effective especially in dynamic or evolving projects.
- Dynamic Exploration: Lack of formal, specific tests make this ideal for scenarios where the software evolves, and requirements are not fully defined.

Efficiency:
- Agile Test Execution: Rapid identification of defects, making it suitable for agile and fast-paced development cycles.
- Less Replicable: Can be difficult replicating specific scenarios, which may impact efficiency in regression testing.


**Manual Functional Testing for ATM System:**

Benefits:
- Structured Approach: Provides a systematic and structured method for testing the ATM system's functionalities.
- Clear Documentation: Well-documented test cases enhance repeatability and facilitate tracking.

Tradeoffs:
- Less Adaptability: May be less adaptive to changes, making it challenging to cope with evolving requirements.
- Potential Miss of Unspecified Scenarios: Relies heavily on predefined test cases, potentially missing scenarios not explicitly documented.

Effectiveness:
- Thorough Coverage of Specified Scenarios: Ensures that specific scenarios outlined in test cases are covered thoroughly.
- Controlled and Predictable: Predictable outcomes make it suitable for stable and well-defined projects.

Efficiency:
- Repeatability: Allows for repeatability and consistency in testing, aiding regression testing and standardization across workforces.
- Structured Regression Testing: Well-suited for regression testing, ensuring that known scenarios are repeatedly tested.

The use of either exploratory testing and manual functional testing consequently depends largely on the context of the application. Exploratory testing proves useful in dynamic projects with evolving requirements as test cases are made on a need basis. Quick and dynamic testing is a benefit whereas manual functional testing favors a more structured and stable approach with well-defined test cases. MFT provides clear documentation to enable repeatability and tracking but exploratory prioritizes finding unexpected and unique defects and scenarios to cover its bases. Where one testing approach lacks the other makes up for in terms of documentation and edge cases. In development settings, a balanced approach may be desirable to harness the benefits of each method. Implementing exploratory testing in the early stages allows for the discovery of defects in dynamic scenarios, and structured regression for stable functions will allow for overall robustness and repeatability in the testing stage.


# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

The peer reviews resulted in the distinction of some variation of results, leading to the recheck and alteration of corresponding defect reports. Nevertheless, the majority of defect reports were the same for all pairings. Each pair’s reports on the backlog, however, varied and so a combination of the most accurate part of each was chosen to be a part of the final report. For example, if a bug was common amongst two issues, then the recreation steps of one of the issues and the better layout of the output of the other issue were combined into one.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

Initially, the length of the assignment outline had led our team to doubt our skillset and spend much more time than necessary on background information, before beginning the lab work. The actual lab activities were consequently divided and assigned to the members close to the deadline, which led to confusion and frustration. A lesson from this lab is to consider the lab tasks close to the release of the assignment criteria and coordinate among the members before beginning any personal review of corresponding course material. Additionally, it could be beneficial to begin the lab prior to making sure that every part of it is clear, because ensuring solid understanding often also leads to an overwhelming feeling of distress. This would result in more efficient communication among team members.  


# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Our group only has three members, consequently, coordinating a system where each of the lab criteria, that was designed for a four member group, became a challenge. For example, it was imperative to complete pair testing and compare results, however, with three members, this became difficult. We overcame this challenge by implementing a system where we would switch partners regularly throughout taking the tests which allowed for each of us to experience and learn from pair testing while also comparing two test results to ensure precision. 


# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

The assignment instructions within the ReadME file and powerpoint slides were very organized and comprehensible. The lab’s objectives and procedures were thoroughly described which was very useful. Nevertheless, there was also lots of repetition in the lab activities which reduced productivity. 

Moreover, certain aspects of the software proved challenging, particularly for individuals unfamiliar with the intricacies of ATM calculations. The distinction between "Available" and "Total Balance" was not clearly defined initially, leading to some confusion. Additionally, the role of the number of $20 bills in the ATM machine's startup process lacked sufficient clarification.
